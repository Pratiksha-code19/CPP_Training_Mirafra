1. Core Classes and Structure
a. MenuItemNode (Linked List Node for Menu Item)
This represents each menu item in a restaurant's menu. Each MenuItemNode contains:

name: The name of the menu item.

price: The price of the menu item.

next: Pointer to the next menu item (for linked list structure).

Linked List Structure: The menu items are connected in a linked list format, where each node points to the next item.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. Restaurant (Restaurant Class)
Each restaurant has:

name: The name of the restaurant.
menuHead: Points to the first MenuItemNode in the restaurant's menu (the head of the linked list).
Methods:

addMenuItem: Adds a menu item to the restaurant's menu by inserting a new MenuItemNode at the head of the linked list.
display: Displays all menu items in the linked list format.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c. Order (Order Class)
Each order represents an order placed by a customer from a restaurant. It has:

customerName: Name of the customer placing the order.
restaurant: Pointer to the restaurant from which the order is placed.
items: A vector storing the MenuItemNode pointers corresponding to the items ordered by the customer.
Methods:

addItem: Adds a menu item to the order.
totalPrice: Calculates the total price of the order by summing the prices of all items.
display: Displays the order details (customer name, items ordered, and total price).
d. CircularOrderQueue (Circular Queue for Orders)
A circular linked list to manage orders that are placed:

head: Points to the first order in the queue.
tail: Points to the last order in the queue.
Methods:

enqueue: Adds an order to the queue.
processOrder: Processes the order at the front of the queue, removing it after processing.
e. FoodOrderingSystem (Main System Class)
This class manages the overall food ordering process:

restaurantMap: A hash map (unordered map) to store restaurants by name.
orderQueue: A circular queue that manages all placed orders.
Methods:

addRestaurant: Adds a new restaurant to the system.
addMenuItemToRestaurant: Adds a menu item to an existing restaurant.
displayRestaurants: Displays all restaurants and their menu items.
placeOrder: Allows a customer to place an order with specified items.
processOrder: Processes and removes the next order from the queue.
showMenu: Displays the main menu and handles user input.
System Flow and Diagram
The system flow can be visualized with the following interactions:

Restaurant Creation:

User adds a restaurant (e.g., "Restaurant A").
The system creates a Restaurant object and stores it in restaurantMap.
Menu Item Addition:

User adds a menu item to a restaurant (e.g., "Burger" for "Restaurant A").
A new MenuItemNode is created, added to the linked list of the restaurant's menu (menuHead).
Placing an Order:

User places an order by specifying the customer name, restaurant name, and items.
The system looks up the restaurant in restaurantMap, finds the menu items, and creates an Order object.
The items ordered are added to the Order object using addItem (this stores pointers to MenuItemNode).
The order is then enqueued in the CircularOrderQueue.
Processing Orders:

The system dequeues the next order from the circular queue and displays its details.
The order is processed and removed from the queue.

Flow Summary:
Step [1]: Add a restaurant to the system.
Step [2]: Add a menu item to the restaurant.
Step [3]: Menu items are stored in a linked list in the restaurant.
Step [4]: A customer places an order, which references menu items from the linked list.
Step [5]: The order is placed in the circular queue for processing.
Step [6]: The system processes the next order from the queue, displays its details, and removes it from the queue.
This setup creates an effective way to manage restaurants, menu items, orders, and a circular order queue for processing customer requests.
